CatJS
==============

## Reports
Currently catjs supports, console and JUnit reports

### Location
  Any type of reports generated by CatJS are being created in "reports" folder below "cat-project" folder.  
     
#### Naming Convention
  The reports path and file names are as follows:
  ./cat-project/reports/[date]/[guid]/[entity_device_type_model.ext]
  
  * folder names
    + **date** DD-MM-YYYY
    + **guid** Unique Id generated for each test, all of the reports related to that test will be aggregated respectively
    
  * **file name** 
    + *entity* The type of the entity [test | device | junit]
    + *type* The type of the device [Browser | Device]
    + *mode* Details about the type
    + *ext* 
        + JUnit - XML format
        + Other types - JSON format

### JUnit
On each running tests a JUnit XML file is been created below the test deployment. It then can be consumed by Jenkins or other reporters that supports JUnit.
 
### Console
On each running tests the test output is been printed to catjs monitor console.

### Settings
In the test project (cat.json), that can be found in the test deployment below 'cat' folder, the available reporters can be customized and/or it can be set to on/off.
  Currently the available customization relates to an array that the reporters types can be added or removed.
